# TODO App

## Objective

The goal of this project was to create a todo app while using ES modules

The main goals were to:

- Use ES6 modules
- Use factory functions and modules
- Be able to create projects (or notes)
- Be able to create tasks
- Be able to edit/delete tasks
- Save everything locally

## Overview

This project was pretty difficult for me. The actual coding part was relatively easy. However, due to external factors I stopped working on the project and had to come back and relearn many things. Due to this I definitely don't feel like this is my best work. I did what was required of me, but it was not very pretty.
